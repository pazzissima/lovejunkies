Ramada’s Tango Salon style is described as elegant, smooth, musical, and playful and is noted especially for the deep emotional expression of his dance movements.  Also a professional musician, he is able to interpret the complexities of the music of tango, which gives him a distinct advantage that he incorporates into his dance.

  <p id="biotext4" class="cms-editable biotext">Originally from Russia, Sonya Nagaslaeva began dance lessons in early childhood. She chafed under traditional ballet style and explored other types of self-expression in art, such as contemporary dance, ballroom and contact improvisation. In 2002 she joined the Musical Theater of V.D. Stefaniev where she performed as a dancer and actress and got her first experience as a choreographer. In 2007, she moved to the US and in 2008 she was introduced to Argentine Tango. Tango became her biggest passion in life. Sonya trained in Chicago and eventually went to live in Buenos Aires to learn from the greatest maestros of the world.</p>

  <p id="biotext4" class="cms-editable biotext">Alona Gorer started to dance at the age of 12. She fell in love with
      tango after seeing the “Forever Tango” show in New York City. While
      Alona has dabbled in all flavors of the dance, her preferred styles
      are the exquisitely elegant shades of Salon. She was frequently the
      featured performer at milongas, and participated in stage productions.
      Alona took silver in the 2013 Argentine Tango USA Championship (Salon
      category, partnered with Leo Landa). Her passion for Argentine tango
      is rivaled only by her passion for one-of-a-kind custom performance
      dress design. “Love Junkies” features some of her recognizably lavish
      custom dresses, including the “Diva Ariela” dress. Alona can be
      frequently found at the milongas throughout the San Francisco Bay
      Area.</p>

  <p id="biotext4" class="cms-editable biotext">Leo Landa had an intense interest in tango music of all kinds since
      before he can remember. Upon encountering the dance of Argentine
      tango, he became a devoted student of the art, quickly turning into an
      avid tanguero on the local Argentine tango scene. He most enjoys
      social, intimate styles. Leo has performed at various local milongas
      and on stage. Leo took silver in the 2013 Argentine Tango USA
      Championship (Salon category, partnered with Alona Gorer). He can be
      frequently found at the milongas throughout the San Francisco Bay
      Area.</p>
