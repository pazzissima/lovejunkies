  <div class="bio"><span id="name1" class="cms-editable name">JEREMY JONES</span> - <span id="role1" class="cms-editable role">Song Writer</span>
  <p id="biotext1" class="cms-editable biotext">Jeremy Jones, a talented guitarist & singer-songwriter from New Orleans, washed up in the San Francisco Bay after being a vagabond and traversing the Asian continent for several years. While meditating on top of the Himalayan mountain range and deep in trance, he was struck by a vision that music moves at the speed of love. Coming down from the mountain, he decided to spread the experience.</p><p>

Jeremy's music blends the mud of the Louisiana swamps with the grit of American roots & soul and the psychedelic tones of San Francisco. He also integrates worldly elements as a result of his many adventures around the globe and his love for all kinds of music. As a guitarist he draws influence from virtuoso players such as Jimi Hendrix, Duane Allman & Trey Anastasio. His singing style is heavily influenced by the raspy voices of rock, blues, soul & gospel greats of past & present.</p><p>

Jeremy has had the privilege of supporting well-known artists such as Ivan Neville&#8217;s Dumpstaphunk, Eddie Roberts (The New Mastersounds), Eric McFadden (P-Funk), Stu Allen & Mars Hotel, and Dead Winter Carpenters. He has shared the stage with virtuosos such as Dan Lebowitz (ALO), Josh Clark (Tea Leaf Green), Jeff Miller (New Monsoon), Sean Leahy (Guitarmaggedon), David Lockhart (Dead Winter Carpenters), Jordan Feinstein (Jordan & the RituaL) as well as world-class violinist Matthias McIntire & renowned jazz trumpeter George Bell. The nationally recognized singer-songwriter Jeff Campbell once posted, “Jeremy Jones is a badass guitar player,” after seeing him perform at San Francisco’s Bottom of the Hill in 2012.</p><p> 

In 2009, Jeremy teamed up with multi-instrumentalist & producer Jesse Sheehan to record his debut album, From Here On, which was recorded in San Francisco and self-released in 2010. This all-acoustic concept album features a 10-piece band of world-class musicians from around the globe, and it touches on genres ranging from jazz & folk to orchestral & raga music. The album was written while backpacking & motorcycling across the Himalayas in 2008, and lyrically, it reflects on the transformative inner journey of that adventure. The album is also a nod to the late Nick Drake, one of Jeremy’s biggest influences & musical inspirations at the time.</p><p>

Jeremy co-founded Bay Area jam bands Jigsaw Night & Magilla Magpie, both of which were short-lived, but achieved noteworthy independent success in the live music scene. He was also a member of the psychedelic pop rock group OCHO, a band led by singer-songwriter Zac Brown, an artist who has recorded & toured internationally. Jeremy has been a guest performer in several prominent Bay Area bands, including Guitarmaggedon, and he has performed at notable Bay Area venues, such as Boom Boom Room, The New Parish, Bottom of the Hill, Brick & Mortar, and Ashkenaz. He has also performed at music festivals, such as Festival international de Louisiane & the Lost Sierra Hoedown.</p>
